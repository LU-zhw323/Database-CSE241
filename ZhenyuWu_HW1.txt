Q1:
select ID from instructor where name='Uno';

Q2:
select distinct building from department natural join instructor where instructor.salary >= 100000 order by department.building;

Q3:
select student.name, student.dept_name, instructor.name, instructor.dept_name from student, advisor, instructor where student.id=advisor.s_id and advisor.i_id=instructor.id and student.dept_name='Comp. Sci.' and instructor.dept_name='History';

Q4:
select T.id, T.name from student T where T.dept_name = 'Statistics' and T.tot_cred < (select MAX(S.tot_cred)/10 from student S where S.dept_name = 'Statistics');

Q5:
select ROUND(AVG(salary)) from instructor where instructor.dept_name='Philosophy';

Q6:
select dept_name, COUNT(name) total_advised from (select instructor.dept_name, student.name from student join advisor on student.id=advisor.s_id join instructor on advisor.i_id=instructor.id) group by dept_name order by dept_name;

When I run select instructor.dept_name, student.name from student join advisor on student.id=advisor.s_id join instructor on advisor.i_id=instructor.id where instructor.dept_name='Mech. Eng.'; which is to find all dept_name of instructors from 'Mech. Eng.' department who advise students and all students' name that are advised by those instructor. This query return me zero attribute which should mean there is no instructor from Mech. Eng department who advise students. Another proof is that when I run select name from instructor where dept_name = 'Mech. Eng.', it also returns nothing, meaning Mech. Eng. department doesn't have any instructor. That's why the query I wrote above missed Mech. Eng. department.

Q7:
select year, COUNT(id) enrolled from (select distinct student.id, year from takes, student  where takes.id = student.id) group by year having COUNT(id) > 1000 order by year;
